local variables
- declare a local variable + reference in the same block
--> value correct / no unidentified value errors

local vars should not persist between blocks
- declare a local variable within a block
- reference the variable in a subsequent block
--> unidentified local variable error

@ vars should still work
- declare a @ var
- reference @ var in another block
--> ok no errors

global vars should still work
- declare a global var
- reference global var in subsequent block
--> ok no errors

breakpoints
- local vars should work in breakpoints
- object @ vars should not throw errors in breakpoints
- global $ vars should work in breakpoints
