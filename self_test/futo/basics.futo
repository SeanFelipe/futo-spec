# 25Oct2021 we are restricting .chizu files to only matching fn's, + chizus/shared directory
confirm only exact filenames are slurped up + shared directory

* run specific file with multiple chizus but nothing in the shared directory
--> only the chizu which matches the specified file is matched

* run all tests with multiple chizus but nothing shared
--> each futo matches to only one chizu

* run all tests with multiple chizus and shared chizus
--> each futo matches to only one chizu
--> shared chizus are also included
