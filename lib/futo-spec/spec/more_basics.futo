wrapped / long lines
- what to do with long bullets or descriptions that have a <Cr> for readability ?

state
- lines starting with "** using setup:" load state for the whole file
- will need levels of scope for this

included_in
- support included_in keyword
- test bullets can map to previously mapped chizus, rather than repeating code
- included_in report should show assumed duplicates, to be verified that they're actually still duplicates
